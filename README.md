## doujinstyle.com üåê

> DoujinStyle functions as an index of content found publicly on the Internet

*[https://doujinstyle.com/?p=dmca](https://doujinstyle.com/?p=dmca)*

In this case, "content" being mostly music.

## Format üì¶

Exports each entry into a singular JSON file containing W.I.P.

## Time & Breakage ‚è≥

Since we are scraping and parsing from the website's public HTTP, and not from any kind of API, it is very likely this project will not
last long into time. The website need only become prettier, modifying or adding HTML, the existing parser will most likely break.

It is also likely the website may modernize in a way that adds a cruel CAPTCHA or rate limiter.

There is also the possibility of the website being taken down, somehow. At the time of writing this, it is written "Version 3" near the
site's logo, implying other versions of the website might have been taken down, or just modernized.

## Motivation üíø

While searching for a high quality FLAC recording of [LEMON MELON COOKIE](https://youtu.be/5l8VZEyNRH8) ([TAK](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCktjMRvuBnE_XLVWIMa2H1w)), I stumbled upon this website, it immediately sparked a flame of need within me; the need to **SCRAPE**; doujinstyle.com
looked so *docile and scrapable*, I couldn't resist but to scrape it to the bone!
